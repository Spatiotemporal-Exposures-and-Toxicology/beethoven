Merge and save covariates in 3 separate data.frames

-   one for only-spatial covariates (index = site_id)

-   one for yearly spatial covariates (index = site_id, year)

-   one for spatio-temporal covariates (index = site_id, time as days)

```{r}
merge_covariates()
```

If we try to merge all the data.frames, we get a memory error (Error: vector memory exhausted (limit reached?). Even a storage per year is not possible. We'll have to deal with parallel computing on the cross validation batches to train the ML models.
